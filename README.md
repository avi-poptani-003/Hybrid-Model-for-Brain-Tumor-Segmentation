## Introduction
This project aims to provide accurate brain tumor segmentation using advanced U-Net architectures. By leveraging VGG16 as the encoder backbone, these models achieve high performance in medical image segmentation tasks. The models have been trained and tested on linux based Super Computer with an approx training time of 20hr.

## Models
The repository contains implementations of the following models:
- `VGG16_U-Net`: Standard U-Net with VGG16 encoder.
- `VGG16_Attention_U-Net`: U-Net with attention mechanism added to the VGG16 encoder.
- `VGG16_Scaler_Attention_U-Net`: U-Net with scaler attention blocks.
- `VGG16_MCA_U-Net`: U-Net with multi-scale channel attention.
## Architecture

## Dataset
The models were trained and evaluated on a comprehensive dataset of brain MRI images. We have created our own dataset combining it with different sources and based on that we have achieved our Results.
